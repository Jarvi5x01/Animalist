            <h2>I WANT TO EAT YOUR PANCREAS</h2>
            <h4>(Kimi No Suizō o Tabetai)</h4>
            <p>
                A Japanese animated film adaptation of the novel, titled I Want to Eat Your Pancreas (君の膵臓をたべたい Kimi no

                For most of the male protagonist’s life, he hasn’t had friends, pursued friendship, or entertained
                anyone who approached him. However, then comes Sakura, bubbly and for some reason wanting to talk to the
                boy who goes out of his way to isolate himself. This comes as a shock to everyone and raises quite a few
                eyebrows. Yet, slowly but surely, due to her persistence, the male protagonist warms up to Sakura and
                arguably falls for her.

                However, there is one major issue: Sakura’s pancreas is rotting. Now, the word cancer isn’t specifically
                used, but it is clear Sakura’s pancreas, a part of the body which helps regulate insulin and produces
                enzymes to break down food, is failing. Thus, she believes she doesn’t have long to live. But, rather
                than worry the friends she has had since she was a child, she approaches the boy who she has seen as her
                opposite. Though, taking note of her philosophy, it seems all her decisions up till her 17th year have
                been made so they could meet. Just because the universe knew there would come a time they’d need each
                other.
                <br>
                As gone into more below, a noticeable part of the film will be Sakura saying, in nearly every other
                line, how she is going to die. Now, considering the movie ends with her funeral, you’d think you’d feel
                nothing by the time it happens since it has been beaten into your head this girl is going to die. Yet,
                as the male protagonist (a name used since it is significant to the ending) grows closer to Sakura, she
                grows on you.

                Maybe it is because you see her opening the male protagonist up and bringing him from stoic to invested.
                Perhaps the reason why you come to love Sakura, and her friendship with the male protagonist, is because
                neither of their personas are rooted in family trauma? While the father is MIA, the male protagonist has
                a good relationship with his mom, and Sakura’s people are loving, as are her friends.
