            <h2>THE GIRL WHO LEAPT THROUGH TIME</h2>
            <h4>(Toki o Kakeru Shōjo)</h4>
            <p>
                At Kuranose High School in Tokyo, Japan, Makoto Konno discovers a message written on a blackboard and
                ends up inadvertently falling upon a walnut-shaped object. On her way home, Makoto is ejected into a
                railroad crossing when the brakes on her bicycle fail and is hit by an oncoming train, but finds herself
                transported back to the point in time when she was riding her bicycle right before the accident. After
                entering the Tokyo National Museum to meet with Kazuko Yoshiyama, she explains to Makoto after hearing
                her story that clearly, she now has the power to "time-leap", to literally leap through time. At first,
                Makoto uses her powers to avoid being late, getting perfect grades, and even relive a single karaoke
                session for several hours, but soon discovers her actions can adversely affect others.
                <br>
                Consequently, Makoto uses most of her leaps frivolously, to prevent undesirable situations from
                happening, including an awkward love confession from her best friend Chiaki Mamiya. Makoto realizes that
                she has a numbered tattoo on her arm indicating the limited number of times she can time leap. Using her
                remaining time leaps, Makoto attempts to make things right for everyone. When Chiaki calls Makoto to ask
                if she has been time-leaping, she uses her final time leap to prevent Chiaki's call. In the meantime,
                Makoto's friend Kōsuke Tsuda and his new girlfriend, Kaho Fujitani, borrow her faulty bike. Makoto
                attempts to stop them, but because she had just used her final leap, she is unable to rescue them from
                the train.
                <br>
                A moment later, Chiaki freezes time, telling Makoto that he is from the future. He explains that the
                walnut-shaped object is a time-traveling device, and he used it to leap through time hoping to see a
                painting that is being restored by Kazuko, as it has been destroyed in the future. While walking with
                Makoto in the frozen city, Chiaki also explains why he stayed longer in her time frame than he
                originally planned. Consequently, he has used his final leap to ensure Kōsuke's existence and has
                stopped time only to explain to Makoto now that he is unable to return to his own time period, and
                having revealed his origins and the nature of the item that allowed Makoto to leap through time, Chiaki
                must leave. Makoto then realizes she loves him.
                <br>
                True to his words, Chiaki disappears once time resumes. Initially distraught by Chiaki's disappearance,
                Makoto discovers that Chiaki's time-leap inadvertently restored her final time-leap: Chiaki had leaped
                back to the time before Makoto used it. Makoto uses it to safely leap back to the moment right after she
                originally gained her powers, when Chiaki still had his remaining time-leap. Recovering the used up
                time-travel device, she explains her knowledge of everything as she shows the device to Chiaki. Makoto
                vows to ensure the painting's existence so Chiaki can see it in his era. Before Chiaki departs, he tells
                Makoto he will be waiting for her in the future. When Kōsuke asks her where Chiaki went, she says he
                went to study abroad, and she has made a decision about her own future.
